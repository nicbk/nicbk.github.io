<h1 id="go-for-more-than-two-players">Go for more than two players</h1>
<p>Rengo is a version of Go that can be played with four players.
In this rendition of Rengo, any number of players can join a room
to play together.</p>
<h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>
<p>The rules are the same as in regular Go.
There are two teams: white and black.
Players will be alternately assigned to teams as they join.
A player can quit the game at any time.
However, there is also a <code>pass</code> button to simulate passing in other
Go variations, whereby a player can skip their turn.
If all players skip their turn in order, then the game ends.
A player who has just passed is denoted with their row filled red.</p>
