  <p>SHA-256 was quite similar to SHA-1 in many ways, and much of the code used to
implement SHA-1 was borrowed.
The project is hosted <a href="https://github.com/nicbk/sha-256">here</a>.
I also implemented SHA-512, which is hosted
<a href="https://github.com/nicbk/sha-512">here</a>.</p>
<p>Blockchains have always been on my mind, so perhaps I will implement a little
blockchain next.
My purpose in doing these little projects has been to understand how these
ubiquitous yet esoteric technologies work under the hood.
I never feel satisifed solely using a library; I feel like I know what I am
doing if I can reproduce functionality with my own reasoning.</p>
