  <p>I recently read <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">The Rust Programming
Language</a>.
The whole language feels very cohesive. It has an official package repository
located at <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a>.
Although I am not a fan of centralized packaging solutions, the clear benefit
of this system is its ease of use.
Libraries can be added to a project by simply adding the name of that library
to the project configuration file.</p>
<p>I thought that a great first project would be to implement the <a href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4">Secure Hash
Standard (NIST FIPS 180-4)</a>, which
includes the SHA-1 and SHA-2 (SHA-256, SHA-512, &hellip;).
Yesterday I implemented SHA-1, and its repository is located
<a href="https://github.com/nicbk/sha-one">here</a>.
I have not optimized it.
This is quite obvious as hashing GNU Make, which is about a megabyte large, took
multiple seconds.
However, before I return to SHA-1, I might as well implement SHA-256 and
SHA-512.</p>
