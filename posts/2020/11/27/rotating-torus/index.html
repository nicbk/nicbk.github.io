  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: An browser based rotating torus which uses similar source code can be viewed <a href="/projects/ascii-donut">here!</a></p>
<p>I recently read about a <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html">spinning
donut</a>, and decided to render
one for myself. My donut is <a href="https://github.com/nicbk/donut-embedded">here</a>. I
commented out the source code quite a bit and used lengthy variable
names in order to make the source code easier to understand.</p>
<p>This project is an application of mathematical concepts I had recently learned
in school. Specifically, I wanted to reimplement all of the necessary math
functions needed for rendering a parameterized torus without using any
libraries. Instead, I would rely on basic floating point arithmetic to derive
numerical approximations for more complicated functions.</p>
<p>My parameterized torus uses three parameters: one for rotation of the torus
about the X and Z axis, one for rotating the circular cross section of the torus
about its current axis of revolution, and another for rotating a point around
that circle.</p>
<p>The sine function is approximated using a Maclaurin series with eight terms on
the interval \( [-\pi/2, \pi/2] \), which is then extended to approximate the
function on the domain of all real numbers using modular arithmetic. In order
to compute this power series, I need exponentiation and the factorial function.
However, neither of these operations are primitive arithmetic operators in the
C programming language. For exponentiation of floats to non-negative integers,
I used iterated multiplication. For the purposes of the Maclaurin series, \( 0^0 \)
is assumed to be 1. The square root function is approximated using Newton&rsquo;s method,
which is executed recursively.</p>
<p>The motion of the entire animation is periodic, so the sine and cosine
functions are memoized such that approximately 1000 values of those functions on
the interval \( [0, 2\pi] \) are stored in an array. When rendering each point
on the torus, these tables are looked up, instead of recalculating the function
on each iteration.</p>
<p>Lighting is done through a single directional light (vector) positioned in front of the
torus. Rays of light and the normals to the surface of the torus are multiplied
as a dot product to determine luminosity. A &ldquo;Z&rdquo; buffer is used to prevent
clipping, as the ray will often intersect multiple surfaces on the moving torus.</p>
